#**GO:Terms method**
This method annotated an emapper output based on their GO:Terms specified in this very output. It simply tells you which genes in your emapper output have a particular GO:Term of your choice. This allows you to know whihc genes belong to a particular module/ family (like for example whihc genes are transcription factors) as long as you know the GO:Term that identifies that module. More information about GO:Terms can be found in the [Gene ontology resource website](http://geneontology.org/)

For demonstration purposes we will keep our example of:  Which genes in the *Capitella* *teleta* genome are transcription factors (TFs).

## **Required files**
### Emapper output
We need to know to whihc GO:Terms our target genes belong to,  
To do so, we need a proteome (or genome) in FASTA format, in our case *Capitella teleta*'s proteome. We run it using [emapper](http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de/) with standard values. We save the output file in a folder as is.

### GO:Term
This is not a file per s√©, is just the GO identifier that encapsulates the gene module we want to annotate. In this case the GO:Term for transcription factors is `GO:0003700`:





##**The pipeline**
### Python
For this pipeline you don't need to import any file. Just open your script, and import the following packages
```
import goterms
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

now, to run the pipeline, as long as you know your GO:Terms and the path to your emapper output you should be able to run
```
cap_annotated = GOTerms_annotation("path/to/capitella_emapper.txt", GOterm="GO:0003700")
print(cap_annotated)
```

this should aoutput a list with all the genes/proteins in the ampapper file that have that GO:Term.
there are some optional parameters one can add. `extra_columns` flag allows you to input a list with all the extra columns in the emapper output you want to include other than the genes column.

```
cap_annotated = GOTerms_annotation("path/to/capitella_emapper.txt", GOterm="GO:0003700", extra_columns=["GOs", "ECs"])
print(cap_annotated)
```
Finally if you wish to keep all columns from emapper output you can use the flag `keep_all_columns = True`. 


### **Command line**
You can see all options in the command line orthogroup function simply with
```
python geneannotator/Orthogroup_argparse.py -h
```


1. **-em**
Path to emapper output run with your target proteins you want to annotate [Emapper output](###-emapper-output).
2. **-g**
Goterm code you want to search in the emapper output.

#### Run pipeline
Simply run the pipeline like so:

```
python geneannotator/goterms_argparse.py -em /path/to/Capitella_emapper.txt" -g "GO:0003700"
```
This utputs a list with all the genes/proteins in yout emapper that contain the specified GO:Term.
There are some extra flags that modify the output. `-x` allows you to input emapper column names you would like to see in the output. For example if you also want to see the other GO:terms and eggnog Orthogroups yo can run 

```
python geneannotator/goterms_argparse.py -em /path/to/Capitella_emapper.txt" -g "GO:0003700" -x"GOs" -x"eggNOG_OGs"
```
Additionally with the `--keep_all_columns` flag you can keep all emapper output columns.
