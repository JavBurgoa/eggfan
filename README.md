<br></br>


EggFan (**Egg**nog based **F**unctional **an**notator) consists of three separate but complementary pipelines that annotate the function of any gene/protein of your interest, using some publicly resources. These resources are [Egggnog](http://eggnog5.embl.de/#/app/home), [emapper](http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de/) and the Phylome, all resources made and mantained by the Jaime Huerta Cepas lab in the CBGP unit of Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.

If you want to know more about each pipeline, check out the vignettes in the github repository.
