# Geneannotator
![Venn diagram](geneannotator.png "The three pipelines complementarity")
In v0.0.1 there are three separate but complementary pipelines to annotate the function of any gene/protein of your interest, using some publicly available resources. These resources are [Egggnog](http://eggnog5.embl.de/#/app/home), [emapper](http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de/) and the Phylome, all resources made and mantained by the Jaime Huerta Cepas lab in the CBGP unit of Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.

If you want to know more about each pipeline, check out the vignettes in the github repository.
